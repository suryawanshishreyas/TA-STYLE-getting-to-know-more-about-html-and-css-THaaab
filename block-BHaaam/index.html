                        Riot had a huge, steady revenue stream from League of Legends. This allowed them to spend years tinkering around and experimenting before they started full scale production. As such, it took a total of six years to develop. At a company that isn’t blessed with gigantic piles of cash lying around, development a multiplayer-only shooter would generally be more like two to four years.

                    All this assuming tens of millions of dollars in budget and a team of over a hundred people.

                            Tim Sweeney had been programming games since he was just 11, obsessed with the rapidly developing computing industry -- and now has an estimated net worth more than £5.94billion.</p>

                        <p>
                            Epic Games wasn't born until 1991, when Tim Sweeney, then a 21-year-old mechanical engineering student at the University of Maryland, released the company's first game, ZZT.

                            With a favourable reception from its few thousand dedicated fans, ZZT helped Sweeney establish a reputation for himself and for his company, and Epic, originally located at Sweeney's parents' house in Maryland, quickly grew into a proper business.

                            In 1998 Epic released first-person shooter game Unreal, which ran using Sweeney's powerful new game development software: the Unreal Engine.

                        <p>
                            He realised that there was money in polishing the engine he had made and selling it to other game developers, and Epic became best known for the Unreal Engine - which is used to power most big-name games, including Fortnite.

                            This is what game developer of Apex Legends Chad Grenier had to say after two years of its EA title.

                            I’ve been at Respawn since the studio’s formation in 2010 and have had the privilege to work on many great games, including Apex Legends from the very beginning.

                            In just a few days we will be celebrating our two year anniversary so we’ve been doing some reflecting and reminiscing on how we’ve gotten to where we are today. I’d like to take a brief moment to share a bit of the story.

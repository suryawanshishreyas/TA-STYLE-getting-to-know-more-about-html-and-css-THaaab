                            Tim Sweeney had been programming games since he was just 11, obsessed with the rapidly developing computing industry -- and now has an estimated net worth more than Â£5.94billion.</p>

                        <p>
                            Epic Games wasn't born until 1991, when Tim Sweeney, then a 21-year-old mechanical engineering student at the University of Maryland, released the company's first game, ZZT.

                            With a favourable reception from its few thousand dedicated fans, ZZT helped Sweeney establish a reputation for himself and for his company, and Epic, originally located at Sweeney's parents' house in Maryland, quickly grew into a proper business.

                            In 1998 Epic released first-person shooter game Unreal, which ran using Sweeney's powerful new game development software: the Unreal Engine.

                            He realised that there was money in polishing the engine he had made and selling it to other game developers, and Epic became best known for the Unreal Engine - which is used to power most big-name games, including Fortnite.
